Growing up in Hawai'i surrounded by its unique ecosystems inspired my passion to protect them. I am currently studying Environmental Science at Chaminade University, where I've worked on projects and research about renewable energy, native species conservation, and sustainable community practices.

I've done studies about light pollution and it's affect on migratory birds
